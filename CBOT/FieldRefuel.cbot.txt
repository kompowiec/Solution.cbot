// FieldRefuel -- The purpose of this program is to extend the
// range of attack bots. It takes them too much energy to get
// out in the field to have to go back and refuel, so I just
// let them run as they will and have this program running on
// a dedicated bot all the time.
//
// It runs in conjunction with a public function I have on all
// my bots called FlatGround - when their energy level gets below
// 1/4, they look for the nearest flat spot at least 50 meters
// away from all enemies and goes to sit there to wait for
// refuelling. This prevents the refuel bot from sliding off a
// hillside and botching the switch.
//
// The bot that runs this sits at the power station, and when a
// bot gets to 1/4 energy it goes out to its position. The 2nd
// goto(bot.position) is to compensate for movement between the
// time that it hit the low power mark and found flat ground.
//
// It goes out to the downed bot, swaps cells (it assumes the
// fuel bot is holding 1 full cell at all times), and refuels.
// When it's done, it pulls back off the pad to make room for
// others.
