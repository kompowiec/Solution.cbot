//How to use LOS
//Returns a Boolean; true if the line of site is clear
//false if the line of site is obstructed
//
//Syntax: LOS(Object Target, float Scan Spacing)
//
//Scan Spacing is the distance between test points.
//The smaller this number is the more accurate your test will be
//However, you may find that if you use to small of a number
//or are checking over a very long distance (as in form one
//side of the map to the other) that the program that called
//this command may lag during this process.
//I recommend a scan of 3 to 5, however it is dependant on the 
//extremes of the map you are playing. On some maps you can
//easily get away with a scan of 10, on others you need to use
//one or two.
//
//Since this function is listed as public you can access this
//program from any bot, as long as it is loaded in one bot.
//The bot that is holding this code may be running another program 
//or nothing at all.  Keep in mind that if the bot holding this 
//code is destroyed things could get messy until you load it back 
//up in a new bot... I've fond shilders running a self defense
//program are wonderful for holding public code.
//if you wish to use this code for an internal call simply remove
//the "public" and copy and paste the code into your program.
//Enjoy!
